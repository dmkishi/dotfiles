# `.zshenv`
#
# PURPOSE: Used for setting ENVIRONMENT variables that should be available in
# all instances of the shell, including scripts and non-interactive sessions.
#
# LOADED WHEN:
# - Always loaded first.
# - Always loaded by all instance of zsh, even non-interactive ones like scripts.
#
# COMMON USE:
# - Defining universal environment variables, e.g. `PATH`, `EDITOR`, etc.
# - Minimal setup, as it affects all zsh processes.
#
# BEST PRACTICE: Keep it lightweight to avoid issues in non-interactive scripts.
