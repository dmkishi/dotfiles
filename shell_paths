# Dedicated config file for shell paths, which allows DRY alias configs for both
# Bash and Zsh. This file must be referenced by both .bashrc and .zshenv:
#
#   if [ -f ~/.shell_paths ]; then
#     source ~/.shell_paths
#   fi
#
# NOTE: Don't use `export`. See <https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/26059>.




# Add ~/bin (append)
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin

# For Homebrew (prepend)
#
# A few, select packages require superuser privileges, such as `arping`. They
# are installed here.
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:$PATH

# For Go (append)
# PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
