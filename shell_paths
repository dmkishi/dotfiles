# Dedicated config file for shell paths, which allows DRY alias configs for both
# Bash and Zsh. This file must be referenced by both .bashrc and .zshenv:
#
#   if [ -f ~/.shell_paths ]; then
#     source ~/.shell_paths
#   fi
#
# NOTE: Don't use `export`. See <https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/26059>.




# Add ~/bin (append)
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin

# For Brew (prepend)
PATH="/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"

# For Go (append)
# PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
